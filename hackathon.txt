- keeping track of the people who are on the scene
	- personal accountability system
	- tags on each firefighter
		- tags go on firetruck
		- tags on firetruck are given to on premise chief
	- problem is that incident commander has to rember to collect tags
	- has to have that stuff, if you don't have it, too late to get it
	- need a system that is passive
		- don't need to do anything if person shows up on scene
		- geofencing, firefighters who are on scene show up automatically
		- need to know what floor fightfighter is on
		- where the firefighter is in real time
	- passive, no one has to do anything; but real time, everyone is aware of what is going on
	- logs after the fact based on who was there
		- if someone was on a scene where there was hazardous materials, we should be able to tell everyone who was there
	- needs to cover a wide area

	- important to note where people have already been

- take information from the scene and log it
	- provide context for legal battles 
	- collect information on scene in real time
	- get information to the dispatch center
	- speech to text feature
		- prevent important people from having to type in information
			- ex. nurse, or someone one scene
	- trend information about heart rate, blood pressure
		- machine learning?
		- detect information that may lead to quicker decisions about condition of patient
	- heart rate can be transfered to computer, then getting information from computer to hospital
		- website to capture the information, link can be given to hospital

	- vital info to law enforcement, fire dep, etc
	- information while enroute to/from scene
		- do we need a helicopter (don't have time for ambulance, need helo)

- lots of case reports, text to speech could be useful
	- for law enforcement, each moment they are on computer they are not helping out
	- log audio and give best transcript of audio to text

- communication is key

- streamline processes for all services

- radio communications are not reliable (digital coms)

- digital coms need to be reliable and able to operate even when offline

- important that they can get on radio and communicate when incidents happen
	- inform dispatch, keep them in check so that they don't send backup when it's not needed
		- false negatives

- below 100
	- keeping speed down
	- having checkboxes checked
		- bulletproof vest on
		- etc
	- making sure that officers are not using computers while car is in motion

- classification and handline of drugs via url
	- identification of photo (ML)
		- something that can reliably confirm the type of drug
	- then information about how to handle
		- pictures of rquipment

- gamification of the below 100 idea
	- pitting forces against each other
		- brandon police force vs sufu police force
	- scales, keeps police forces of seperate sizes able to compete against one another equitably


- drone that follows person and provides connectivity


- as accurate as possible, don't autocorrent keep raw
	- par - personal accountability record


- generating reponse area
	- public events for certain are listed
		- existing events can be joined in on by other departments responding to the scene
			- ex. police are on scene and are reporting to the website already, firefighters just join lobby when they get on scene
		- being able to filter data
			- data to police might not be pertinant to fightfighting team
			- compartimentalization of information
		- prevent people who arent supposed to know about informaion (secret  clearance only)
		- HIPA compliance
	- have everything marked as classified by default, have to mark it as unclassified

- system to keep comms syncronized and data private as needed
	- try to do geolocation so that people can be checked in on scene automatically
		- "geofencing"
		- register people to a "lobby" automatically as they enter an area (via website)
	- by reporting on data, you check into scene
		- keeps log of people on scene
		- keeps log of messages
	- prevents people who shouldn't see information from seeing it
		- marking data as classified by default
	- text to speech
	- communication between departments
	- real time data, and caching when offline
		- data updated on page automatically via websockets
	- easily sharable to other parties via url
		- hospitals
	- allow dispatch to know that party is safe
		- ex. police let dispatch know they are safe by reporting in every 5 min via notification
			- notification has security on it so that a person can not fake it
	- handle showing who is on the scene
		- as well as ranking and hierarchy of command
		- allow messaging between people
	
	- layout
		- website
			- able to signify distress (in some capacity)
			- updates with websockets
			- handles geolocation, sending geolocation data to server so that a "lobby" can be joined
			- allows sending notifications of safety in advance (with password)
			- handles notifications, sends response to server (encrypted)
			- caches while offline
			- allows pictures, video, and audio to be taken
			- shows hierarchy of people on scene and their departments
				- police/fire/emt are each in their own categories
					- but the people there can be seen
				- allows updating of hierarchy, editing of information about person (like who officer reports to
		- server
			- handles accounts for people, their classification and secret data status (what data they can see)
			- handles orchestration of connections
			- handles geolocation data
				- so that people at the same scene can be connected in a similar area
				- so that geolocation data can be logged too
			- handles rerouting connections
			- handles sending out notification every X minutes depending on the responder
				- send out notification to police every 5 minutes, take action if they have not responded in enough time
					- ex. notify dispatch if a certain person has not given their notification
			- handles logging data (pictures, video, audio)
			- handles text to speech operations
			- handles filtering classified information, while still logging
		- note for presentation
			- other data could be transmitted
				- heartbeat, blood pressure, etc
			- other data could be analysed on
				- using machine learning, etc
			- pictures could be analyzed on
				- using deep learning, etc


- having the ability to join remotely, search for events by location, name, etc
- having ability to have people check in automatically when they enter geofence
- provide information about how far away other services are
	- ex. helocopter is 5 hours away, provide updates to other people in event lobby

presentation:

	- Make note of the privacy of the voice data being streamed (it's not stored by API (Google) etc)
